# REGRADER

Regrader is a VST2/3/AU plug-in which provides a delay effect in which the repeats degrade in
various ways to provide a nice twist on the ears. The delays repeats can be synced to the
hosts tempo and time signature and be fully automated.

## On compatibility

### Build as VST 2.4

VST3.0 is great and all, but support across DAW's is poor (shout out to Bitwig Studio for being awesome). You can however build this plugin as a VST2.4 plugin and enjoy it on a wider range of host platforms. Simply uncomment the following line in _CMakeLists.txt_:

```
set(SMTG_CREATE_VST2_VERSION "Use VST2" ON)
```

And rename the plugin extension from _.vst3_ to _.vst_.

Note: at the moment of writing there is an issue in SDK 3.6.9 where the VST2 plugin wrapper isn't working correctly on macOS. To correct this, add the following line to _"VST3_SDK/public.sdk/source/main/macexport.exp"_ :

```
_VSTPluginMain
```

## Compiling for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures:

Depending on your host software having 32-bit or 64-bit support, you can best compile for a wider range of architectures, to do so replace all invocations of _cmake_ in this README with the following:

### macOS:
```
cmake "-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64;i386" ..
```

Note: while i386 is considered deprecated in macOS, though you'd be surprised to find out how many people are
running a 32-bit version of a DAW in this day and age...

### Windows:
```
cmake.exe -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
cmake.exe -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win32" ..
```

## Build instructions

### Environment setup

The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) to generate the build system after which you can use _make_ to build the application.

Apart from requiring _CMake_ and a _g++_ compiler, the only other dependency is the [VST SDK from Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html).

## Generating the Makefiles

The project has been developed against the [VST3 SDK version 3.6.9](https://download.steinberg.net/sdk_downloads/vstsdk369_01_03_2018_build_132.zip) on macOS and Windows 10 and should work completely via CLI without requiring either Xcode or Visual Studio (for both command line/build tools suffice). Linux build system is provided, but is as yet untested.

Additionally, the Steinberg VST sources need to be built as well. Following Steinbergs guidelines, the target is a _/build_-subfolder of the _/VST3_SDK_-folder, execute the following commands from the Steinberg VST SDK root:

```
./copy_vst2_to_vst3_sdk.sh
cd VST3_SDK
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

The result being that in _{VST3_SDK_ROOT}/VST3_SDK/build/lib_ all Steinberg VST libraries are prebuilt. Windows users need to append _--config Release_ to the last cmake (build) call.

### Building the Regrader plugin

Run CMake to generate Regrader's Makefile for your environment, after which you can compile the plugin using make. The build output will be stored in _./build/VST3/regrader.vst_ as well as copied to your systems VST-plugin folder.

You must provide the path to your custom SDK download location by providing _VST3_SDK_ROOT_ to CMake like so:

```
cmake -DVST3_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/ ..
```

#### Compiling on Unix systems:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVST3_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/ ..
make .
```

#### Compiling on Windows:

Assuming the Visual Studio Build Tools have been installed:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake.exe -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DVST3_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/VST_SDK/VST3_SDK/ ..
cmake.exe --build .
```

### Running the plugin

You can copy the build output into your system VST(3) folder and run it directly in a VST host / DAW of your choice.

When debugging, you can also choose to run the plugin against Steinbergs validator and editor host utilities:

    {VST3_SDK_ROOT}/build/bin/validator  build/VST3/regrader.vst3
    {VST3_SDK_ROOT}/build/bin/editorhost build/VST3/regrader.vst3

### Build as Audio Unit (macOS only)

Is aided by the excellent [Jamba framework](https://github.com/pongasoft/jamba) by Pongasoft, which provides a toolchain around Steinbergs SDK. Execute the following instructions to build Regrader as an Audio Unit:

* Build the AUWrapper Project in the Steinberg SDK folder
* Create a Release build of the Xcode project generated in step 1, this creates _VST3_SDK/public.sdk/source/vst/auwrapper/build/lib/Release/libauwrapper.a_
* Run _sh build_au.sh_ from the repository root, providing the path to _VST3_SDK_ROOT_ as before:

```
VST3_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/VST_SDK/VST3_SDK sh build_au.sh
```

The subsequent Audio Unit component will be located in _./build/VST3/regrader.component_ as well as linked
in _~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/_

You can validate the Audio Unit using Apple's _auval_ utility, by running _auval -v aufx dely IGOR_ on the command line. Note that there is the curious behaviour that you might need to reboot before the plugin shows up, though you can force a flush of the Audio Unit cache at runtime by running _killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar_.
